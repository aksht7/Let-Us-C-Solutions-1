# [Periodic Test -3] Solutions
## [A]

      (1) Base Address
      (2) Index and Size
      (3) number
      (4) 0
      (5) different
   
## [B]
    
    (1) False
    (2) True
    (3) True
    (4) True
    (5) True
    
## [C] 

    (1) It Overwrite the next elements present in the memory.
    (2) When we want to know information about every element in an array .This can just only be done with help of structures.
        Example: If we have elemts of char type then the characters are in a sequence that we are unable to find the correct info.
        but with help of structure we can easily distinguish that and easily get to know about the name
        Suppose we made an array VIKASKUMAR. Here we dont know that Vikaskumar is one person or Vikas is one and kumar is another it can only 
        be Identified with the help of structures.
    (3) The limitation is that we cant just declare an array of pointers. We can overcome this by initialiing an array of pointers along with its declaration.
    (4) In 2D array a[4][4] is an array.Mentioning the array name in C or C++ gives the base address in all contexts except one.
        Syntactically, the compiler treats the array name as a pointer to the first element.You can reference elements using array 
        syntax, a[n], or using pointer syntax, *(a+n), and you can even mix the usages within an expression.
    (5) For recieving multiwords strings using scanf we can write it as 
        scanf("%[^\n]s,stringname) in some compliers while others accept normally scanf("%s",stringname).
        gets(stringname).
